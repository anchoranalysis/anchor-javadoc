# 
# This workflow will build Javadocs for the various anchor Java projects aggregated together (but excluding the GUI).
#
# It is only triggered on master branch.
#
# It also:
#  -  uploads the built Javadoc in a JAR to GitHub Packages
#
# The Maven working directories are cached for future reuse, as downloading all packages from scratch takes significant time.
#
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-maven
